#Part1: The limits of Basic Python Strings

#Using the script:
#email = input("whats's your email? ").strip()
#if "@" in email:
     #print("valid")
     #else:
     #print("Invalid email")
# This is a simple script that asks for an email, which then reads the inputed "@" to determine wather its valid or not.

#The flaw fo this script is that its only making assumptiions that any string input that contains "@" is valid (e.g "hello@")

#Fixing that flaw: by adding a second condition "if, in, and"
import re
def main():
    email = input("What's your email? ").strip() #this line prompts the user to input their email address, removes any leading or trailing whitespace using the strip() method, and assigns the cleaned email address to the variable 'email'.

    if "@" in email: #this line checks if the "@" symbol is present in the email address. If it is not found, the condition will evaluate to False, and the code will skip to the else block.
        username, domain = email.split("@")

        if username and domain.endswith(".ac.uk"):
            print("Valid") #this script if spacific to uni based email address
        else:
            print("Invalid") #if the email address does not contain "@" or does not meet the specified conditions for a valid email, it will print "Invalid".
    
    #Part2: indroducing the reModule


# def is_valid_email(email):#this line defines a function named is_valid_email that takes a single parameter email. The function will use regular expressions to check if the provided email address is valid according to specific criteria.


# if re.search(r".+@.+\.ac.uk$", email): #this regular expression checks if the email address has a username (.+), followed by an "@" symbol, then a domain name (.+), and finally ends with ".ac.uk" ($ indicates the end of the string)
#     print("valid email") #will print valid email if the regular expression matches the input email address
# #Part3: Tightening the rules with Anchors and Sets

# if re.search(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$", email):
#     print("valid email") #this regular expression checks for a more general email format, allowing for various characters in the username and domain, and ensuring a valid top-level domain (TLD) of at least 2 characters.

# #Part4: Shorthand Syntax and "OR"Logic
# if re.search(r"^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.(ac\.uk|gov\.uk|nhs\.net)$", email):
#     print("valid email") #this regular expression uses shorthand syntax to simplify the pattern, where \w matches any word character (alphanumeric and underscore), and the "OR" logic allows for either a specific domain or a more general format.
#     #to expand the rules to incdlude other domains
